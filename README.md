# The-Funding-for-Waste-Water-COVID-Testing-
Given a set of data, we used the colorado covid data downloaded from the Colorado Department of Pcublic Health and Environment. It contains 4 variables: The date, the particular utility, SARS CoV2 copies of RNA (measured as RNA/liter of water) in wastewater, and number of new Covid-19 cases. 
The first graph is "All Utilities: Wastewater RNA vs COVID−19 Cases"
The second graph is The same as the first, but there is a legend with color coded points. Each city has its own color. 
The third graph is the same as the second, but instead of the points on the graph, we conveyed the variables with lines. Still color coded. The lines followed a clearer trend of the variables. 
The fourth graph took the lines of the variables and showed "log(SARS−CoV−2 Copies/L) over Time Separated by Utility"
